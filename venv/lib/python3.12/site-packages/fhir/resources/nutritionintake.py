    A record of food or fluid that is being consumed by a patient.   A
    NutritionIntake may indicate that the patient may be consuming the food or
    fluid now or has consumed the food or fluid in the past.  The source of
    this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family

    information is captured is during the history taking process during a
    patient visit or stay or through an app that tracks food or fluids
    consumed.   The consumption information may come from sources such as the
    patient's memory, from a nutrition label,  or from a clinician documenting
